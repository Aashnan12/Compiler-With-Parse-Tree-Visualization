##" Compiler-With-Parse-Tree-Visualization" 

This project proposes a comprehensive compiler framework that unifies tokenization, syntax and semantic analysis, parse tree visualization, structured error reporting, scope tracking, intermediate code generation, computational complexity estimation, and a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance both usability and technical insight.
Developed in C/C++, the compiler features custom-built components for lexical analysis, context-free grammar parsing, and intermediate representation (IR) generation. The system statically analyzes control flow structures such as loops, conditionals, and comments, and provides time/space complexity estimation using static analysis techniques. A built-in GUI enables users to interactively explore the parse tree, inspect token streams, view error diagnostics, and analyze variable/function scope resolution in real-time.
